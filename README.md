## Description 
This particular script was created in 2019 for a 3D game called "Museum of Sculptures". This game constituted the assignment for the elective course "Human 
Computer Interaction" of my undergraduated studies in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Ioannina. SceneManager is responsible to load and unload the scenes of the game without any confilcts.
